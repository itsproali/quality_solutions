    description: `<p>Attention all pharmaceutical professionals! üî¨üíä</p>
    <p>We are excited to announce the &quot;Simplify the Processes: Improve Quality and Efficiency in Pharma&quot; idea generation event! This is your opportunity to showcase your innovative ideas for improving quality and efficiency in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
    <p>For example, in the dispensing room, one person from Production and one person from Quality Assurance are always present to check the weight of each material. Then both persons sign the batch document against each material. Isn&rsquo;t it time consuming activity? Isn&rsquo;t it difficult to comply?</p>
    <p>Instead, you can use a printer with the weighing balance. So, you will get a printout of every weight of the materials. What&rsquo;s the benefit?</p>
    <p>Now, your Production and QA personnel need not to present all the time in the dispensing room. They can check the weight print-out later. In the meantime, they can do other things to improve efficiency. Print-out is evidence of data. So, it is improving Quality Compliance.</p>
    <p>You can implement this very easy simplification to improve Quality and Efficiency of the dispensing process!</p>
    <p>We invite you to submit your ideas online. Each participant can submit up to 3 ideas using our dedicated Google Form. Your ideas will be evaluated based on their potential for Quality Improvement, Compliance Improvement, Cost Reduction, and Efficiency Improvement.</p>
    <p>Take advantage of this exceptional opportunity to make a lasting impression in your sector:</p>
    <p>üèÜ&nbsp;Top 20 ideas will be rewarded with a certificate and exclusive resources</p>
    <p>üìö&nbsp;100 best ideas will be compiled in our &quot;<strong>Pharma Simplifiers Idea Book</strong>&quot;!</p>
    <p>üåê Selected best ideas will be presented in webinars!</p>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity and help reshape the future of the pharmaceutical industry. Join this groundbreaking event, and let your ideas be known!</p>
    <p>We are eager to discover the simplification solutions you&apos;ll present! Together, let&apos;s optimize processes, elevate quality, and enhance efficiency! üí°üöÄ<br><br></p>
    <p>Deadline for submissions: <strong>15 June 2023</strong></p>
